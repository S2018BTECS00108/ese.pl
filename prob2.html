      <h1>Seamless Invoicing and Reconciliation System</h1>
      <img src="invoice.jpg" alt="INVOICE">
      <p>1. At present, Adani raise more than 10,000+ invoices annually. 2. Tracking outstanding of each invoices with respect to each customers is very difficult. 3. Our marketing team should focus only on bringing customers. An automated transaction system which acts independently for invoicing and payments reconciliation. 4. A wallet for customer which can be accessed through a portal. Payments can be made offline through banks or pay using UPIs/Internet Banking/NEFTs/RTGS Relooking at the problem: 1. Invoices are generated in our Terminal Operating System (TOS). 2. Customer should be able to view the invoices on a portal. 3. They can clear the invoices either partially or full. 4. They might make an Ad-hoc payment (advance payment) which should be available in wallet and then uses that amount to settle the invoices. 5. Dashboard – Current Outstanding, payment dues, invoices pending to be cleared, interest loss etc. If we look at the entire process: 1. Vessel agent submits the ETA 2. Port Authority does the berth and resource planning. 3. Operations are undertaken. 4. Invoices for services are raised 5. Sent to customer for payments 6. Customer makes the payment 7. Payment advise(s) are shared 8. Corresponding invoices are cleared in our SAP system. 1. Can we relook the Invoice settlement process? • Is it possible for our Customer to settle the invoices in our system? Let’s say we create an instance of out TOS for customers to come and do the payment settlements. 2. How to reduce the Payments to invoice settlement TAT? • Customer makes the payment and realizing that amount paid in our Finance Statement takes additional day or two. Can it be made real time.</p>
